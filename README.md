  - Business Problem Solving
  - Git and Github
  - Machine Learning techniques


# Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider for professionals, faces a low lead conversion rate of around **30%**. While the company generates numerous leads daily through website visits, marketing campaigns, and referrals, only a small fraction convert into paying customers. The lead conversion process involves several stages, from acquiring leads to nurturing them through education and communication before conversion. However, the current approach results in inefficiencies, as the sales team invests significant time and effort in contacting all leads, regardless of their potential to convert. To address this issue, X Education aims to identify "Hot Leads"â€”the most promising prospects likely to convert. By focusing on these high-potential leads, the sales team can optimize its efforts, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately improve the overall lead conversion rate. This targeted strategy will help the company drive growth while making the sales process more effective and efficient.
The company requires to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around **80%**.

# Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study:

1.Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

2.There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
